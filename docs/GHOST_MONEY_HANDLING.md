# Ghost Money: Handling Speculative Funds Failure

## The Nightmare Scenario

```
User A has 0 USDT

T+0:    BTC-ME executes: User A sells 0.1 BTC → +5000 USDT (Dirty)
T+10µs: Risk Engine receives Hot Path → Balance: 5000 USDT (Dirty)
T+20µs: User A places order: Buy 0.1 ETH with 5000 USDT
T+30µs: ETH-ME executes → User A has 0.1 ETH, User B expects 5000 USDT

T+50µs: BTC-ME CRASHES before writing to Redpanda 💀

Result:
- User A has 0.1 ETH they didn't pay for
- User B sold ETH expecting real USDT
- Exchange is missing 5000 USDT
- The BTC sale "vanished" (Ghost Money)
```

## Why You Can't Just "Cancel" the ETH Trade

```
User B (ETH seller) might have already:
  → Used the 5000 USDT to buy XRP
  → User C sold XRP expecting that USDT
  → User C used USDT to buy DOGE
  → ...

Cascading rollback = Market chaos
```

**Once a trade is in the Log, it's FINAL.**

## Solution 1: The Debt Model

When the system reconciles, it forces the balance update:

```
Log Event 1 (MISSING): BTC Sale never hit Redpanda
Log Event 2 (PRESENT): ETH Buy hit Redpanda

Replay Logic:
- "User A bought 0.1 ETH for 5000 USDT"
- Check balance: 0 USDT
- FORCE the debit anyway

User A Balance:
  USDT: 0 - 5000 = -5000 USDT (DEBT)
  ETH:  0 + 0.1  = 0.1 ETH
```

**User A now has NEGATIVE balance = Exchange loaned them the money.**

## Solution 2: Auto-Liquidation Protocol

```rust
struct RiskEngine {
    balances: HashMap<(UserId, AssetId), Balance>,
}

impl RiskEngine {
    /// Called during reconciliation or periodic check
    fn check_negative_balances(&mut self) {
        for ((user_id, asset_id), balance) in &self.balances {
            if balance.total() < 0 {
                self.trigger_liquidation(*user_id, *asset_id, balance.total());
            }
        }
    }

    fn trigger_liquidation(&mut self, user_id: UserId, debt_asset: AssetId, debt: i64) {
        log::error!("LIQUIDATION: user={} owes {} of asset {}",
            user_id, debt.abs(), debt_asset);

        // 1. Lock account (no new orders, no withdrawals)
        self.lock_account(user_id);

        // 2. Find assets to sell
        let sellable_assets = self.find_sellable_assets(user_id);

        // 3. Inject market sell orders
        for (asset_id, amount) in sellable_assets {
            // Calculate how much to sell to cover debt
            let sell_order = Order {
                user_id,
                side: Side::Sell,
                order_type: OrderType::Market,
                symbol_id: get_trading_pair(asset_id, debt_asset),
                quantity: amount,
                // This is a SYSTEM order, bypasses balance check
                is_liquidation: true,
            };

            self.inject_liquidation_order(sell_order);
        }

        // 4. After liquidation settles, check remaining debt
        // Insurance fund covers any remaining loss
    }
}
```

### Liquidation Flow

```
Detection: Risk Engine sees USDT_Balance = -5000

Step 1: Lock Account
  → User can't withdraw
  → User can't place new orders
  → Existing orders canceled

Step 2: Forced Liquidation
  → System injects: SELL 0.1 ETH @ MARKET
  → Trade executes: +4950 USDT (slippage)

Step 3: Settlement
  → Balance: -5000 + 4950 = -50 USDT

Step 4: Insurance Fund
  → Exchange covers the -50 USDT
  → User balance: 0 USDT
  → Account unlocked (maybe with warning)
```

## Solution 3: Prevent Ghost Money (Local WAL)

**The ME must write to local disk BEFORE sending Hot Path UDP.**

### Bad Flow (Ghost Money Risk)
```
Match → Send UDP → Write to Disk
              ↓
        CRASH HERE = Trade vanishes
```

### Good Flow (Safe)
```
Match → Write to Local WAL → Send UDP
                    ↓
              CRASH HERE = Trade still on disk
```

```rust
impl MatchingEngine {
    fn execute_trade(&mut self, trade: Trade) {
        // Step 1: Write to LOCAL WAL FIRST (NVMe, fast)
        self.wal.append(&trade)?;
        self.wal.sync()?;  // fsync - data is on disk

        // Step 2: NOW safe to send Hot Path
        self.send_hot_path(&trade);

        // Step 3: Async send to Redpanda (Cold Path)
        self.send_cold_path(&trade);
    }
}
```

### Recovery After Crash

```
ME restarts:
1. Read local WAL from last checkpoint
2. Find trades NOT in Redpanda (missed Cold Path)
3. Re-publish to Redpanda
4. The "Dirty" funds were real - just late!
5. Math balances out
```

## Solution 4: Withdrawal Firewall

**Hard Rule: You can TRADE with dirty funds, but CANNOT WITHDRAW them.**

```rust
struct Balance {
    // Confirmed by Cold Path (Redpanda)
    confirmed: u64,

    // Speculative from Hot Path
    speculative: Vec<SpeculativeCredit>,

    // Locked for pending orders
    locked: u64,
}

impl Balance {
    /// For TRADING - includes speculative
    fn tradeable(&self) -> u64 {
        self.confirmed + self.speculative_total() - self.locked
    }

    /// For WITHDRAWAL - only confirmed funds
    fn withdrawable(&self) -> u64 {
        self.confirmed.saturating_sub(self.locked)
    }
}
```

### Why This Matters

```
Trading: Internal database update
  → Fast
  → Reversible via liquidation
  → Mess stays inside exchange

Withdrawal: Blockchain transaction
  → Slow (confirmation time)
  → IRREVERSIBLE
  → If wrong, money is GONE
```

**The worst case (Ghost Money) stays inside the exchange where you can fix it.**

## Complete Risk Engine Implementation

```rust

    balances: HashMap<(UserId, AssetId), Balance>,
    account_status: HashMap<UserId, AccountStatus>,
}

#[derive(PartialEq)]
enum AccountStatus {
    Active,
    Locked,        // Can't trade or withdraw
    Liquidating,   // Forced sells in progress
}

    confirmed: i64,               // Can be negative (debt)!

            }

            // Remove stale credits (they were Ghost Money)

    }
}

## Summary: Ghost Money Handling

| Scenario | Detection | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Hot Path lost, Cold Path arrives | Normal flow | Apply Cold Path directly |
| Cold Path lost (ME crash before disk) | Stale speculative (30s) | Revoke + potentially liquidate |
| Both lost (catastrophic) | Reconciliation with DB | Force correct, liquidate if needed |
| User spent ghost money | Negative balance | Auto-liquidation + insurance |

## Safety Layers

```
Layer 1: Local WAL
  → ME writes to disk BEFORE Hot Path
  → Minimizes Ghost Money window

Layer 2: Speculative Timeout
  → 30s without Cold Path confirmation = revoke
  → Limits exposure

Layer 3: Withdrawal Firewall
  → Can't withdraw speculative funds
  → Worst case stays inside exchange

Layer 4: Negative Balance Detection
  → Immediate account lock
  → Auto-liquidation

Layer 5: Insurance Fund
  → Covers remaining debt after liquidation
  → Exchange absorbs tiny loss vs slow everyone down
```

**The entire system is designed to contain the blast radius of Ghost Money within the exchange, where it can be fixed, rather than letting it escape to the blockchain.**
